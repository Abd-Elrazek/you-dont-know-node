# Event Loop

---

![inline](images/non-blocking.png)

^This allows to process other tasks while IO-call not finished like this
^Nginx vs. Apach
^Blocking I/O is expensive!

---


### Basic Event Loop Example

```java
System.out.println("Step: 1");
System.out.println("Step: 2");
Thread.sleep(1000);
System.out.println("Step: 3");
System.out.println("Step: 4");
```

vs.

```js
console.log('Step: 1')
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('Step: 3')
}, 1000)
console.log('Step: 2')
```

---

## Thinking in Async Code

```js
console.log('Step: 1')
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('Step: 3')
  // console.log('Step 5')
}, 1000);
console.log('Step: 2')
// console.log('Step 4')
```

^This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model where OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node are free from worries of dead-locking the process --- there are no locks


---


## It's still possible to write blocking code in Node.js. :flushed:

---

# Blocking Node.js Code

```js
var fs = require('fs');

var contents = fs.readFileSync('accounts.txt','utf8');
console.log(contents);
console.log('Hello Capital One\n');

var contents = fs.readFileSync('ips.txt','utf8');
console.log(contents);
console.log('Hello SECON!');
```

^data1->Hello Capital One->data2->Hello SECON!



---

# Non-Blocking Node.js Code

```js
var fs = require('fs');

var contents = fs.readFile('accounts.txt','utf8', function(err,contents){
   console.log(contents);
});
console.log('Hello Capital One\n');


var contents = fs.readFile('ips.txt','utf8', function(err,contents){
   console.log(contents);
});
console.log("Hello SECON!");
```

^Hello Capital One->Hello SECON->data1->data2

# Streams and Buffers
